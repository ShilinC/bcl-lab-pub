SMART Genomics: Precision Cancer Medicine

A diagnosis of cancer is a life-changing event which is now made all the more complicated by our exploding knowledge about the genetic mutations in tumors. What used to be “breast cancer” or “colon cancer” or “lung cancer” are now many different diseases defined by their genetics and specific treatments associated with these mutations. While the era of “precision cancer medicine” which is rapidly approaching brings the promise of new treatments and possibly cures, it also dramatically increases the cognitive workload for providers and patients alike. This situation is not helped by the fact that electronic health records (EHRs) are not designed to support this rapidly changing field.


The SMART Genomics: Precision Cancer Medicine app is an attempt to enable patients and providers to access cancer genomics information in a secure environment external to an EHR. This iOS app, based on the open source SMART™ platform and communicating via FHIR™, a new and promising HL7 standard, allows a clinician to pull up contextual information about a patient’s cancer genome in the clinic setting, as an aid to cancer care. 


The SMART Genomics: Precision Cancer Medicine app can function with any EHR system supporting the SMART™ on FHIR™ API (see http://smartplatforms.org/smart-on-fhir/ for more details), with the proposed SMART Genomics extension (see http://smartgenomics.wikispaces.com/ for more details).
